# InsightPulseAI Conversion Strategy Playbook

## Overview

This playbook outlines the conversion strategy for InsightPulseAI's digital marketing efforts, focusing on LinkedIn campaigns. The strategy incorporates five key conversion goals, each with specific tracking mechanisms and attribution models.

## Conversion Goals & Tracking

| Conversion Goal | URL | LinkedIn Name | Attribution Target | Priority |
|-----------------|-----|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Signup Completion** | `/signup-success` | `Signup Thank You Page` | Lead acquisition | Medium |
| **Quote Request** | `/quote-success` | `Quote Request` | Business Development | High |
| **Diagnostic Completion** | `/diagnostic-success` | `Diagnostic Tool Completion` | AI Readiness Qualification | Medium |
| **Strategy Call Booking** | `/appointment-success` | `Strategy Call Booking` | High-Intent BD Engagement | High |
| **Email Capture/Download** | Via `/diagnostic-success` | (part of diagnostic logic) | CRM Growth / Retargeting | Medium |

## Call-to-Action Placement

The website features strategic placement of conversion CTAs:

- **Main Navigation**: "Get a Quote" button in primary position
- **Hero Section**: "Take the Free Diagnostic" and "Book a Strategy Call" buttons
- **Bottom CTA**: "Start Free Diagnostic" and "Book a Strategy Call" buttons
- **Pricing Page**: "Get a Custom Quote" button and pricing tier CTAs
- **Contact Page**: Prominent "Book a Strategy Call" CTA with supportive text

## UTM Parameter Strategy

All traffic sources should use consistent UTM parameters:

```
?utm_source=linkedin
&utm_medium=paid
&utm_campaign=campaign_name
&utm_content=ad_variation
```

The website automatically captures these parameters and associates them with conversion events, enabling precise attribution in LinkedIn Campaign Manager.
